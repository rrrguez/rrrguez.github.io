You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Hello! I am a recent graduate in [Computer Engineering](https://www.ull.es/grados/ingenieria-informatica/) from the University of La Laguna.
Specifically, I focused on Software Engineering during my studies.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s in Computer Engineering at the same university. I enjoy programming and design, and in the near future, I would like to focus on web development.

This was the first program I wrote when I started my degree:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Later on, I started creating more complex programs, from solving linear equations like `2x + 4 = 0` to programming full Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), among many others.

Today, I am capable of programming much more complex desktop applications. For example, my Final Degree Project was a tournament management application written in Java for the Computational Thinking Olympiad.

The subjects I enjoyed the most during my degree were:
* Graphic Expression in Engineering
* Fundamentals of Physics in Engineering
* Data Modeling
* Architectural Design and Patterns
* Emotional Intelligence

Throughout my studies, I learned to use the following programming languages:
1. C++
2. Assembly
3. Ruby
4. Java
5. Python (Julia)
