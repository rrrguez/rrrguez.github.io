Hello! My name is Rebeca Rguez. My GitHub nickname, rrrguez, is just a short version of my real name.

I'm a software engineer who's currently pursuing a master's degree in web development at Universidad de La Laguna.

My motivation to study this master's degree is to combine my passion for programming and design to be a web developer in the near future.
